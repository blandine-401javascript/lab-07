/*This is your main server file, which defines all the server functionality. This file should export a server object and a start function. It should also assign all the middleware this server is using (404, 500, timestamp, logging), defined in lib/middleware. Your server should define all the routes for CRUD operations upon products and categories from db.json.

Note that you do NOT have to modify the db.json file when the CRUD operations are executed. Instead, when your server runs, your server.js file should import the contents of db.json and save that as an object. Then, any CRUD routes can modify or return this in-memory object.
